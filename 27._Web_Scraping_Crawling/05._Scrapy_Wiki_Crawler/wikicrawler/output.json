The term is most commonly associated with text materials, either in traditional printed format or online; however, audio, video, and multimedia materials that have been recorded then broadcast, distributed, or archived by a reputable party may also meet the necessary criteria to be considered reliable sources. Like text, media must be produced by a reliable source and be properly cited. Additionally, an archived copy of the media must exist. It is convenient, but by no means necessary, for the archived copy to be accessible via the Internet.\n", "The reliability of a source depends on context.

Similarly, the publisher's web site is likely to be reliable for the fact that the work exists, for the fact that the work was authored by the purported author, and for publication data (publishers are incentivized to be truthful about the works they publish; publishers do not invite copyright suits or inquiries for works that do not exist).

Hamilton asserted that this was appropriate because it would protect the people against abuse of power by Congress:\n", "[T]he courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.\n", "Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental. ...\n", "[A]ccordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the Judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former. ...\n", "\n[T]he courts of justice are to be considered as the bulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments.", "In ", ", Hamilton rejected the idea that the power to decide the constitutionality of an act of Congress should lie with each of the states: \"The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.\"", " Consistent with the need for uniformity in interpretation of the Constitution, Hamilton explained in ", " that the Supreme Court has authority to hear appeals from the state courts in cases relating to the Constitution.", "\n", "The arguments against ratification by the ", " agreed that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review, though the Anti-Federalists viewed this negatively. ", ", writing under the pseudonym \"Brutus\", stated:\n", "[T]he judges under this constitution will control the legislature, for the supreme court are authorised in the last resort, to determine what is the extent of the powers of the Congress. They are to give the constitution an explanation, and there is no power above them to set aside their judgment. ... The supreme court then have a right, independent of the legislature, to give a construction to the constitution and every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to correct their construction or do it away. If, therefore, the legislature pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense the judges put upon the constitution, they will declare it void.", "The first Congress passed the ", ", establishing the lower federal courts and specifying the details of federal court jurisdiction. Section 25 of the Judiciary Act provided for the Supreme Court to hear appeals from state courts when the state court decided that a federal statute was invalid, or when the state court upheld a state statute against a claim that the state statute was repugnant to the Constitution. This provision gave the Supreme Court the power to review state court decisions involving the constitutionality of both federal statutes and state statutes. The Judiciary Act thereby incorporated the concept of judicial review.\n", "Between the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 and the decision in ", " in 1803, judicial review was employed in both the federal and state courts. A detailed analysis has identified thirty-one state or federal cases during this time in which statutes were struck down as unconstitutional, and seven additional cases in which statutes were upheld but at least one judge concluded the statute was unconstitutional.", " The author of this analysis, Professor William Treanor, concluded: \"The sheer number of these decisions not only belies the notion that the institution of judicial review was created by Chief Justice Marshall in ", ", it also reflects widespread acceptance and application of the doctrine.\"", "\n", "Several other cases involving judicial review issues reached the Supreme Court before the issue was definitively decided in ", " in 1803.\n", "In ", ", 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 408 (1792), federal circuit courts held an act of Congress unconstitutional for the first time. Three federal circuit courts found that Congress had violated the Constitution by passing an act requiring circuit court judges to decide pension applications, subject to the review of the Secretary of War. These circuit courts found that this was not a proper judicial function under Article III. These three decisions were appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeals became moot when Congress repealed the statute while the appeals were pending.", "\n", "In an unreported Supreme Court decision in 1794, ", ",", " the Supreme Court reversed a pension that was awarded under the same pension act that had been at issue in ", ".

Although the Supreme Court did not strike down the act in question, the Court engaged in the process of judicial review by considering the constitutionality of the tax.

The opinions of the supreme court, whatever they may be, will have the force of law; because there is no power provided in the constitution, that can correct their errors, or controul their adjudications. From this court there is no appeal.", "In 1820, ", " expressed his opposition to the doctrine of judicial review:\n", "You seem ... to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men, and not more so. They have, with others, the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps. ... Their power [is] the more dangerous as they are in office for life, and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves.", "In 1861, Abraham Lincoln touched upon the same subject, during his first inaugural address:\n", "[T]he candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.", "Lincoln was alluding here to the case of ", ", in which the Court had struck down a federal statute for the first time since ", ".", " Lincoln did more than argue against the finality of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution.

The second argument is that the states alone have the power to ratify changes to the \"supreme law\" (the ", "), and each state's understanding of the language of the amendment therefore becomes germane to its implementation and effect, making it necessary that the states play some role in interpreting its meaning. Under this theory, allowing only federal courts to definitively conduct judicial review of federal law allows the national government to interpret its own restrictions as it sees fit, with no meaningful input from the ratifying, that is, validating power.\n", "In the United States, unconstitutionality is the ", " ground for a federal court to strike down a federal statute. ", ", speaking for the Marshall Court, put it this way in an 1829 case:\n", "We intend to decide no more than that the statute objected to in this case is not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and that unless it be so, this Court has no authority, under the 25th section of the judiciary act, to re-examine and to reverse the judgement of the supreme court of Pennsylvania in the present case.", "If a state statute conflicts with a valid federal statute, then courts may strike down the state statute as an unstatutable", " violation of the ", ". But a federal court may not strike down a statute absent a violation of federal law or of the federal Constitution.\n", "Moreover, a suspicion or possibility of unconstitutionality is not enough for American courts to strike down a statute. ", " explained in ", " that the standard of review should be \"irreconcilable variance\" with the Constitution. Anti-federalists agreed that courts would be unable to strike down federal statutes absent a conflict with the Constitution. For example, ", ", writing under the pseudonym \"Brutus\", asserted that \"the courts of the general government [will] be under obligation to observe the laws made by the general legislature not repugnant to the constitution.\"", "\n", "These principles—that federal statutes can only be struck down for unconstitutionality and that the unconstitutionality must be clear—were very common views at the time of the framing of the Constitution.

But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course.\"", "\n", "For a number of years, the courts were relatively deferential to Congress. Justice Washington put it this way, in an 1827 case: \"It is but a decent respect to the wisdom, integrity, and patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"", "\n", "Although judges usually adhered to this principle that a statute could only be deemed unconstitutional in case of a clear contradiction until the twentieth century, this ", " weakened somewhat during the twentieth century, as exemplified by the Supreme Court's famous ", " in ", ", 304 U.S. 144 (1938), which suggested that statutes may be subjected to closer scrutiny in certain types of cases. Nevertheless, the federal courts have not departed from the principle that courts may only strike down statutes for unconstitutionality.\n", "Of course, the practical implication of this principle is that a court cannot strike down a statute, even if it recognizes that the statute is obviously poorly drafted, irrational, or arises from legislators' corrupt motives, unless the flaw in the statute rises to the level of a clear constitutional violation. In 2008, Justice ", " reaffirmed this point in a ", ": \"[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, ", ", remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'\"", "\n", "In the federal system, courts may only decide actual cases or controversies; it is not possible to request the federal courts to review a law without at least one party having ", " to engage in a lawsuit. This principle means that courts sometimes do not exercise their power of review, even when a law is seemingly unconstitutional, for want of jurisdiction.

To satisfy the first requirement the state must show that the suspect generally understood their rights (right to remain silent and right to counsel) and the consequences of forgoing those rights (that anything they said could be used against them in court). To show that the waiver was \"voluntary\" the state must show that the decision to waive the rights was not the product of police coercion. If police coercion is shown or evident, then the court proceeds to determine the voluntariness of the waiver under the ", " test focusing on the personal characteristics of the accused and the particulars of the coercive nature of the police conduct. The ultimate issue is whether the coercive police conduct was sufficient to overcome the will of a person under the totality of the circumstances. Courts traditionally focused on two categories of factors in making this determination: (1) the personal characteristics of the suspect and (2) the circumstances attendant to the waiver. However, the Supreme Court significantly altered the voluntariness standard in the case of ", ".", " In ", ", the Court held that \"Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to a finding that a confession is not 'voluntary' within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"", " The Court has applied this same standard of voluntariness in determining whether a waiver of a suspect's Fifth Amendment ", " rights was voluntary. Thus, a waiver of ", " rights is voluntary unless the defendant can show that their decision to waive their rights and speak to the police was the product of ", " and coercion that overcame the defendant's free will. After ", ", the traditional totality of circumstances analysis is not even reached unless the defendant can first show such coercion by the police.", " Under ", ", a suspect's decisions need not be the product of rational deliberations.", " In addition to showing that the waiver was \"voluntary\", the prosecution must also show that the waiver was \"knowing\" and \"intelligent\". Essentially this means the prosecution must prove that the suspect had a basic understanding of their rights and an appreciation of the consequences of forgoing those rights. The focus of the analysis is directly on the personal characteristics of the suspect. If the suspect was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or suffered from an emotional or mental condition that substantially impaired their capacity to make rational decisions, the courts may well decide that the suspect's waiver was not knowing and intelligent.\n", "A waiver must also be clear and unequivocal. An equivocal statement is ineffective as a waiver and the police may not proceed with the interrogation until the suspect's intentions are made clear. The requirement that a waiver be unequivocal must be distinguished from situations in which the suspect made an equivocal assertion of their ", " rights after the interrogation began. Any post-waiver assertion of a suspect's ", " rights must be clear and unequivocal.", " Any ambiguity or equivocation will be ineffective. If the suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the interrogating officers are permitted to ask questions to clarify the suspect's intentions, although they are not required to.", " In other words, if a suspect's assertion is ambiguous, the police may either attempt to clarify the suspect's intentions or they may simply ignore the ineffective assertion and continue with the interrogation.", " The timing of the assertion is significant. Requesting an attorney prior to arrest is of no consequence because ", " applies only to custodial interrogations. The police may simply ignore the request and continue with the questioning; however, the suspect is also free to leave.\n", "If the defendant asserts his right to remain silent, all interrogation must immediately stop and the police may not resume the interrogation unless they have \"scrupulously honored\" the defendant's assertion and subsequently obtained a valid waiver before resuming the interrogation.", " In determining whether the police \"scrupulously honored\" the assertion the courts apply a totality of the circumstances test. The most important factors are the length of time between termination of the original interrogation and the commencement of the second, and issuing a new set of ", " warnings before resumption of interrogation.\n", "The consequences of assertion of the right to counsel are stricter.", " The police must immediately cease all interrogation and the police cannot reinitiate interrogation unless counsel is present (merely consulting with counsel is insufficient) or the defendant of his own volition contacts the police.", " If the defendant does reinitiate contact, a valid waiver must be obtained before interrogation may resume.\n", "In ", " (2010), the Supreme Court declared in a 5–4 decision that criminal defendants who have been read their ", " rights (and who have indicated they understand them and have not already waived them), must explicitly state during or before an interrogation begins that they wish to be silent and not speak to police for that protection against self-incrimination to apply. If they speak to police about the incident before invoking the ", " right to remain silent, or afterwards at any point during the interrogation or detention, the words they speak may be used against them if they have not stated they do not want to speak to police. Those who oppose the ruling contend that the requirement that the defendant must speak to indicate his intention to remain silent further erodes the ability of the defendant to stay completely silent about the case. This opposition must be put in context with the second option offered by the majority opinion, which allowed that the defendant had the option of remaining silent, saying: \"Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation.\" Thus, having been \"", "ized\", a suspect may avow explicitly the invocation of these rights, or, alternatively, simply remain silent. Absent the former, \"anything [said] can and will be used against [the defendant] in a court of law\".\n", "Assuming that the six factors are present, the ", " rule would apply unless the prosecution can establish that the statement falls within an exception to the ", " rule.", " The three exceptions are:\n", "Arguably only the last is a true exception—the first two can better be viewed as consistent with the ", " factors. For example, questions that are routinely asked as part of the administrative process of arrest and custodial commitment are not considered \"interrogation\" under ", " because they are not intended or likely to produce incriminating responses. Nonetheless, all three circumstances are treated as exceptions to the rule. The jail house informant exception applies to situations where the suspect does not know that he is speaking to a state-agent; either a police officer posing as a fellow inmate, a cellmate working as an agent for the state or a family member or friend who has agreed to cooperate with the state in obtaining incriminating information.", "\n", "The \"public safety\" exception is a limited and case-specific exception, allowing certain unadvised statements (given without ", " warnings) to be admissible into evidence at trial when they were elicited in circumstances where there was great danger to public safety; thus, the ", " rule provides some elasticity.", "\n", "The public safety exception derives from ", " (1984), a case in which the Supreme Court considered the admissibility of a statement elicited by a police officer who apprehended a rape suspect who was thought to be carrying a firearm. The arrest took place during the middle of the night in a supermarket that was open to the public but apparently deserted except for the clerks at the checkout counter. When the officer arrested the suspect, he found an empty shoulder holster, handcuffed the suspect, and asked him where the gun was. The suspect nodded in the direction of the gun (which was near some empty cartons) and said, \"The gun is over there.\" The Supreme Court found that such an unadvised statement was admissible in evidence because \"[i]n a kaleidoscopic situation such as the one confronting these officers, where spontaneity rather than adherence to a police manual is necessarily the order of the day, the application of the exception we recognize today should not be made to depend on ", " findings at a suppression hearing concerning the subjective motivation of the police officer.\"", " Thus, the jurisprudential rule of ", " must yield in \"a situation where concern for public safety must be paramount to adherence to the literal language of the prophylactic rules enunciated in ", ".\"\n", "Under this exception, to be admissible in the government's direct case at a trial, the questioning must not be \"actually compelled by police conduct which overcame his will to resist,\" and must be focused and limited, involving a situation \"in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety.\"", "\n", "In 2010, the ", " encouraged agents to use a broad interpretation of public safety-related questions in terrorism cases, stating that the \"magnitude and complexity\" of terrorist threats justified \"a significantly more extensive public safety interrogation without ", " warnings than would be permissible in an ordinary criminal case,\" continuing to list such examples as: \"questions about possible impending or coordinated terrorist attacks; the location, nature and threat posed by weapons that might pose an imminent danger to the public; and the identities, locations, and activities or intentions of accomplices who may be plotting additional imminent attacks.\" A ", " spokesman described this position as not altering the constitutional right, but as clarifying existing flexibility in the rule.", "\n", "Prosecutors initially argued that Tsarnaev's pre-", " statements should be admissible under this exception.", " However, the exception was not considered by the court because the prosecutors later decided not to use any of that evidence in their case against Tsarnaev.", "\n", "The ", " upheld the exception in a 2013 murder case, ", ",", " where a man with blood on his clothes was detained and questioned.", "\n", "The window of opportunity for the exception is small.

Additionally, there is a large disagreement whether the concept of an evolutionary landscape should be used as a visual metaphor disconnected from the underlying math, a tool for evaluating models of evolution, or a model in and of itself used to generate hypotheses and predictions.\n", "According to McCoy (1979), the first evolutionary landscape was presented by Armand Janet of Toulon, France, in 1895.", " In Janet's evolutionary landscape, a species is represented as a point or an area on a polydimensional surface of phenotypes, which is reduced to two dimensions for simplicity. The size of the population is proportional to the amount of variation within the population.", " Natural selection (the influence of the exterior features) is represented by a vector. Unlike the evolutionary landscapes of those who would follow, in Janet's concept, natural selection pulls species toward the minima instead of the maxima.

Similarly to Janet, Wright felt the landscape could be reduced to two dimensions for simplicity. (This is one of the greatest criticisms, which are discussed below.) Populations are represented by areas, with the size of the area corresponding to the amount of genetic diversity within the population. Natural selection drives populations toward maxima, while drift represents wandering and could potentially cause a peak shift. Movement across the landscape represented changes in gene frequencies.", " This landscape was represented as a series of contour lines, much like a topographical map; while selection kept or moved a biological entity to a peak, genetic drift allowed different peaks to be explored.", "\n", "In 1944, Simpson expanded Wright's landscape to include phenotypes.", " In Simpson's model, the landscape is a means of visualizing the \"relationship between selection, structure, and adaptation.\"", " Unlike Wright, Simpson used the landscape to represent both natural selection and genetic drift. Uphill movements are due to ", ", and downhill movements are due to ", ". The size and shape of a peak indicated the relative specificity of selection; i.e. a sharp and high peak indicates highly specific selection. Another difference between Simpson's and Wright's landscapes is the level at which evolution is acting. For Wright, a ", ", only populations of a species were shown. In Simpson's figures, the circles drawn represent all of Equidae.", " The most important difference is that in Simpson's model, the landscape could vary through time, while in Wright's model, the landscape was static.

Clusters of peaks inhabited by phenotypically similar populations can be viewed as higher taxonomic levels.", "\n", "The concept of evolutionary landscapes changed once more as the modern understanding of ", " emerged. It is claimed that Maynard Smith (1970) was the first to visualize protein evolution as a network of proteins one mutational step away from others.", " However, for this to be true, there must be pathways between functional proteins.

In other words, not all moves in evolution are \"uphill\".", " In 1984, Gillespie adapted the concept of evolutionary landscapes to nucleotide sequences and so visualized the \"mutational landscape\" whereby all nucleotide sequences are one mutational step away from another,", " which is remarkably similar and yet fundamentally different from Wright's original concept. This conceptual shift, along with the development of vast computational power, has allowed evolutionary landscapes to move from being a simple visual metaphor to a working model of evolution. As one might expect, this has drawn heavy criticism and generated much research.", "\n", "One of the first criticisms (or at least difficulty) with evolutionary landscapes is their dimensionality. Wright recognized that true landscapes can have thousands of dimensions, but he also felt reducing those dimensions to two was acceptable since his point in doing so was simply to  convey a complex idea.", " As a visual metaphor, this might be a valid reduction; however, the work of Gavrilets has shown that taking the high dimensionality of evolutionary landscapes into consideration may matter.", " In a high-dimensional framework, the peaks and valleys disappear and are replaced with hypervolume areas of high fitness and low fitness, which can be visualized as curved surfaces and holes in a three-dimensional landscape.", " While this does not affect visualization of the landscape ", " (i.e. holes are equivalent to valleys), it does affect the underlying mathematical model and the predicted outcomes.\n", "The work of Gavrilets, along with other issues, has prompted Kaplan (2008) to propose abandoning the metaphor of evolutionary landscapes (which he calls adaptive or fitness landscapes).", " Kaplan (2008) has six main criticisms of the metaphor: (1) it has no explanatory power; (2) it lacks a relevant mathematical model; (3) it has no heuristic role; (4) it is imprecise; (5) it confuses more than it explains; and (6) there is no longer a reason to keep thinking in 2D or 3D when we have the computational power to consider higher dimensionality. Others feel Kaplan's criticisms are not warranted because he (and others) want evolutionary landscapes to meet the standards of a mathematical model; however, the landscape metaphor is just that, a metaphor. It has heuristic value as a metaphorical tool allowing one to visualize and evaluate the common core of assumptions in an evolutionary model.", "\n", "While Kaplan (2008) wishes to discard the idea of landscapes all together, ", " is less drastic. He acknowledges four categories of landscapes: fitness landscapes, adaptive landscapes, fitness surfaces, and morphospaces. Fitness landscapes are those similar to what Wright (1932) proposed (called adaptive and fitness landscapes below). Adaptive landscapes are the phenotypic landscapes proposed by Simpson (1944), and fitness surfaces are the phenotypic landscapes with Lande's mathematical models applied to them. Morphospaces, pioneered by Raup (1966), are phenotypic landscapes developed ", " using mathematical models onto which observed measurements are mapped. They lack a fitness axis, and are used to show the occupied areas within the potential phenotypic space. Pigliucci suggests we abandon Wrightian fitness landscapes. Adaptive landscapes and fitness surfaces can be used with caution, i.e. with the understanding that they are not phenotypic versions of Wright's original concept and that they are fraught with potentially misleading assumptions.

Nav1.6 nodal accumulations do not vary in size or immunofluorescence staining activity in typical or atypical nodal sites; however, the proportion of typical nodal sites decreases and increase in atypical nodes in painful tooth samples compared to normal tooth samples. Nav1.7 has an increased expression in typical and atypical nodal sites in painful samples.

Pulp nerve fibers also respond to lower current intensities and only a small number of pulpal nerves are required to create responses when electrical stimulation is applied.
